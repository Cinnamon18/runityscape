GJAPISettings.asset is missing here due to it containing API keys.

It should be autogenerated when one edits the fields in Edit>Project Settings>GameJolt API

If it does not autogenerate:
Download the Plugin from http://gamejolt.com/games/unity-api/15887
and move its GJAPISettings.asset here, setting it up according to the link's instructions.
